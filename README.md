# Customer Purchasing Behavior Exploration

This project aims to explore customer purchasing behavior across various stores by conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The analysis will help us understand how promotions, store openings, and other factors influence customer purchasing patterns.

## Project Overview

### Task 1: Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior

The main objectives of this task are:

- **Data Cleaning:** Build pipelines to detect and handle outliers and missing data to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize various features and interactions to communicate findings effectively.

### Questions to Explore

1. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - Are promotions distributed similarly between training and test sets?
  
2. **Sales Behavior:**
   - How do sales behave before, during, and after holidays?
   - Are there seasonal purchase behaviors (Christmas, Easter, etc.)?

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - What is the correlation between sales and the number of customers?
   - How do promotions affect sales? Are they attracting more customers?

4. **Promo Deployment:**
   - Which stores should promotions be deployed in for maximum effectiveness?

5. **Customer Behavior Trends:**
   - Analyze customer behavior during store opening and closing times.
   - Which stores are open on all weekdays, and how does that affect weekend sales?

6. **Assortment Type and Competitor Distance:**
   - How does the assortment type affect sales?
   - Does the distance to the next competitor matter in sales performance, especially in city centers?
   - How do new competitors affect sales, particularly for stores with previously unknown competitor distances?

### Logging

Throughout the analysis, logging will be employed using the `logger` library in Python for traceability and reproducibility of results.
